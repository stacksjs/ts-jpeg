### Usage

```ts
import { Reader, Writer } from 'ts-gif'

// Reading a GIF
const reader = new Reader(buffer)
console.log(`Dimensions: ${reader.width}x${reader.height}`)
console.log(`Number of frames: ${reader.numFrames()}`)

// Writing a GIF
const writer = new Writer(buffer, width, height, {
  palette: globalPalette,
  loop: 0 // 0 = loop forever
})

// Add frames
writer.addFrame(0, 0, width, height, pixelData, {
  delay: 100, // 100ms delay
  disposal: 2, // Clear frame before next
  transparent: null
})

// Finalize the GIF
writer.end()
```
